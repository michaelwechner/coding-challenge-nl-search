# Coding Challenge: NL Search

## Overview
The REST interfaces were defined using the Swagger Editor (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelwechner/coding-challenge-nl-search/main/openapi3_0.json)

- Upload plain text document(s)
- Search documents(s) using natural language
- Retrieve particular document

The server code was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.
